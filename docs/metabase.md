## Overview

The raw database schema uses:

| Pattern | Problem for Metabase |
|---|---|
| `transactions.metadata` (JSONB) | Requires `->` operators; Metabase's GUI cannot filter JSONB natively |
| `transactions.location_metadata` (JSONB) | Country/city buried inside JSON |
| `kyc_applicants.applicant_data` (JSONB) | KYC fields inaccessible without custom SQL |
| Multi-table joins (users + transactions + vaults) | Analysts re-write the same join every question |

The views in `database/metabase_views.sql` solve all of this by:

- **Flattening every JSONB column** into typed, named columns (e.g. `geo_country`, `meta_campaign`)
- **Pre-joining** the tables analysts always combine
- **Pre-computing** derived columns (success rates, SLA breach flags, rolling averages, retention months)
- Using **plain VIEWs** (not materialized) so every dashboard query always reflects live data

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Apply the views

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f database/metabase_views.sql
```

Re-run at any time — all statements use `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` so it is safe to run repeatedly.

### 2. Verify

```sql
-- Quick sanity check
SELECT * FROM bi_daily_volume LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM bi_transactions LIMIT 5;
```

### 3. Connect Metabase (see [Connecting Metabase](#connecting-metabase))

### 4. Sync the schema and start building questions

---

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `cohort_month` | Month users registered |
| `activity_month` | Month users were active |
| `months_since_signup` | 0 = same month as registration |
| `active_users` | Users with ≥1 completed transaction |
| `transactions_in_period` | Transaction count that period |

**Metabase Pivot Table:** Row = `cohort_month`, Column = `months_since_signup`, Value = `active_users`.

---

## Connecting Metabase

### Option A — Metabase Cloud / Self-hosted UI

1. Go to **Admin → Databases → Add Database**
2. Select **PostgreSQL**
3. Fill in your database credentials (use a read-only role — see [Security Notes](#security-notes))
4. Toggle **"Let users upload data to this database"** → OFF
5. Click **Save**

### Option B — `MB_DB_*` environment variables (self-hosted Docker)

```env
MB_DB_TYPE=postgres
MB_DB_HOST=your-db-host
MB_DB_PORT=5432
MB_DB_DBNAME=your-db-name
MB_DB_USER=metabase_readonly
MB_DB_PASS=your-password
```

---

## Syncing the Schema

After applying the views, tell Metabase to pick them up:

1. **Admin → Databases → [your database] → Sync database schema now**
2. **Admin → Databases → [your database] → Re-scan field values** (populates filter dropdowns)

The `bi_*` views will appear in the Table Browser alongside the raw tables. You can hide raw tables from non-technical users:

**Admin → Data Model → [raw table] → toggle "Hidden"**

Leave only the `bi_*` views visible for self-service analysts.

## Performance: Materialized Views

Plain views always reflect live data but re-run the full query on every page load. For databases with more than ~1 million transactions, create materialized versions for the heavy aggregation views:

```sql
-- Example: materialize the daily volume view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_bi_daily_volume AS
    SELECT * FROM bi_daily_volume;

-- Required for REFRESH CONCURRENTLY (no table lock)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON mv_bi_daily_volume (report_date, currency);
```

Schedule a refresh so the materialized view stays fresh:

```sql
-- Using pg_cron (install once per database)
SELECT cron.schedule(
    'refresh-bi-daily-volume',
    '*/15 * * * *',    -- every 15 minutes
    'REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_bi_daily_volume'
);
```

Uncomment the materialized view blocks at the bottom of `database/metabase_views.sql` to apply them all at once.

> **Tip:** Keep `bi_transactions` as a plain VIEW. Analysts filter it down to a time window so the full table is rarely scanned.

---

## Security Notes

### Create a read-only Metabase role

Grant access only to the `bi_*` views, not the raw tables:

```sql
-- Create a dedicated read-only user for Metabase
CREATE ROLE metabase_readonly LOGIN PASSWORD 'strong-password';

-- Grant connect and usage
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE your_database TO metabase_readonly;
GRANT USAGE   ON SCHEMA public          TO metabase_readonly;

-- Grant SELECT on all bi_ views (run once; repeat after adding new views)
GRANT SELECT ON bi_transactions        TO metabase_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON bi_daily_volume        TO metabase_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON bi_provider_performance TO metabase_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON bi_user_summary        TO metabase_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON bi_kyc_funnel          TO metabase_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON bi_dispute_overview    TO metabase_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON bi_vault_summary       TO metabase_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON bi_webhook_reliability TO metabase_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON bi_pnl_daily           TO metabase_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON bi_geo_distribution    TO metabase_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON bi_user_retention      TO metabase_readonly;

-- Or grant on all current and future views in the schema:
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
    GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO metabase_readonly;
```

### PII considerations

- `phone_number` and `email` are **encrypted** at the application layer. The raw columns in `bi_transactions` and `bi_user_summary` contain ciphertext — they are safe to expose in Metabase but will not be human-readable.
- `stellar_address` is plaintext in the database. If your compliance policy requires it, exclude it by creating a custom view without that column.
- `notes`, `admin_notes`, and `reason` fields on transactions and disputes are also encrypted by the application layer.

### Row-level security (optional)

If you need to restrict Metabase users to specific providers or regions, add a PostgreSQL row-level security policy:

```sql
ALTER TABLE transactions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Example: restrict to a specific provider
CREATE POLICY metabase_provider_filter ON transactions
    FOR SELECT TO metabase_readonly
    USING (provider = current_setting('app.provider', true));
```
